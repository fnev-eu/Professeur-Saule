## Who is it ?!
Willow is the professor who helps us on Pokémon Go. Here, it's also a discord bot, powered by discord.js.
It was created in order to provide information and help moderation on a discord server bringing together Pokémon Go players in Ile-de-France (France).

## Installation
**Node.js 8.0.0 or newer is required.**
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install`
- Copy `config.json.dist` to `config.json` and fill it with your information:
  - Add your token ([How-to](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token))
  - Add the ownerID. It's your ID on Discord (Send `\@<your_nick>` on discord)
- Run `node willow.js` and it works !

However, `pm2` is highly recommended to start your bot.
